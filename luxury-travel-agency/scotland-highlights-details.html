<h4>Day 1: London - Gretna Green - Glasgow (650 Kms)</h4>
<p>Today morning join up with your coach and depart towards Gretna Green. The coach will start from Wembley and do various pick-ups along the M1 and M6 Corridor.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we stop for lunch at Gretna Green, the UK's most famous place to get married and home of the world-famous Iron Forgeries.</p>
<p>We then board back onto the coach and continue making our way North towards Scotland, making our way to the city of Glasgow. We expect to arrive in Glasgow, in the early evening. We make our way straight to Glasgow Cathedral, which is one of Scotland's most magnificent medieval buildings, Glasgow Cathedral is the only one on the Scottish mainland to survive the Reformation of 1560 intact.</p>
<p>We enjoy a delicious Indian meal at the restaurant before boarding our coach and making our way to the hotel for our three-night stay.</p>

<h4>Day 2: Glasgow - Loch Lomond - Fort William - Glasgow (360 Kms)</h4>
<p>After our breakfast, we board the coach and make our way towards the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.</p>
<p>On arrival at Loch Lomond, why not enjoy an optional boat cruise; here appreciate the picturesque views of the highlands, whilst indulging in a warm cup of tea or coffee. The Loch Lomond or "Lake of the Elms" is a freshwater Scottish loch which crosses the Highland Boundary Fault.</p>
<p>We then make our way along the scenic route towards Fort William, to visit the Nevis Range. On arrival, we take a cable car (subject to operation) to Aonach Mòr on the Nevis range. Standing at 1,345 metres above sea level, it is a popular mountain destination. We will also enjoy an Indian lunch here amongst the beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>We will also stop today at the Commando Memorial, which is dedicated to the men of the original British Commando Forces raised during World War II. Additionally, we visit the Neptune's staircase, which is a flight of eight locks on the Caledonian Canal. This amazing feat of engineering raises the canal by 19m over a quarter of a mile of continuous masonry.</p>
<p>We then make our drive back to the restaurant in the evening, before going back to the hotel.</p>

The world's first & only rotating boat lift was opened by Her Majesty, The Queen in 2002. Then, we visit The Kelpies: 30-metre-high horse-head sculptures depicting Kelpies. The sculptures were designed by sculptor Andy Scott and were completed in October 2013.</p>
<p>Arrive into Edinburgh and visit the famous Edinburgh Castle with its fine state apartments and ancient Scottish crown jewels.
